## Notes

### Notes 1 - Hritik UP2115893:

like to connect to people but not available to the public anywhere

### Notes 2 - David UP2049418:

Would like to have the option to input locations themselves, and also input locations in advance e.g. would be in Portsmouth for 3 days and then in London afterward.

### Notes 4 - Oguz UP2157044:

- No, I prefer to choose my own songs and also be able to choose songs inside playlists.

Note: The user prefers to have full control over the songs, wants to select what she likes, able to change song queue and playlists.

### Notes 6 - Tobi UP2079666:

if the weather is nice listen to slower-paced music
if rains listen to upbeat
tweak the playlist
